Hello,

This is a github project that aims to analyse risk factors of the Chronic_Kidney_Disease Data Set. 
At the very end, there is a section that tries to extract correlations between risk factor in order to know what subtypes of CKD.

Please run the jupyter notebook "DataAnalysis_(en)" from your google drive to start

A folder "Wema_CodeChallenge" would be created where the python code and all necessary content are going to be pulled in order to run the project.

The jupyter notebook communicates with pure python code found in the folder "wema_challenge/PythonPart"

The pure python code is used to write functions and modularize the process 

The jupyter notebook is used for the execution of the whole process and for Data visualization

The structure of the jupyter notebook is as follow : 

1- Code importation :
The necessary git command to pull the project

2- Missing Data 
The section that tries to replace missing data

3- Data visualization
Displays plots and graphics in order to know better the data distribution and if a normalization is necessary 

4- Data Analysis
* First approach : Standard approach 
* Second approach : Correlation approach
* Third approach : Model approach : Logistic regression

5- Relationship between risk factors

6- Conclusion
